// Rust style is to indent with four spaces, not a tab.
// Rust is an ahead-of-time compiled language, meaning you can compile a program
// and give the executable to someone else, and they can run it even without having Rust installed

fn main() {
    // ! indicates a macro
    println!("Hello world");
